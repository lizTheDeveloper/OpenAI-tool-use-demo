To use Ngrok on macOS in the Terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Download Ngrok:**
   - Go to the [Ngrok download page](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the macOS version of Ngrok.

2. **Install Ngrok:**
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
   - Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where the Ngrok executable is located. For example, if you extracted it to your Downloads folder, you can run:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ```

3. **Move Ngrok to a directory in your PATH:**
   - It's convenient to move the Ngrok executable to a directory that is already in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`. Run the following command to move it:
     ```bash
     sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/
     ```

4. **Authenticate Ngrok:**
   - Sign up for an Ngrok account if you haven't already, and get your authentication token from the [Ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
   - Run the following command in Terminal to authenticate Ngrok with your token (replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with your actual token):
     ```bash
     ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
     ```

5. **Start an Ngrok Tunnel:**
   - To start an Ngrok tunnel, navigate to the directory where your application is running, or specify the port you want to expose. For example, if you have a web server running on port 5000, run:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 5000
     ```

6. **Access the Public URL:**
   - After starting the tunnel, Ngrok will display a forwarding URL (e.g., `http://12345678.ngrok.io`) that you can use to access your local application from the internet.

By following these steps, you should be able to use Ngrok on macOS in the Terminal to expose your local services to the internet.
